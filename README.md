Tired of AFK players? Check out my free CAPTCHA AFK Script.

When a player goes AFK for too long (configurable in config.lua), theyâ€™ll face a CAPTCHA challenge using OX_LIB. 
If they fail to answer correctly it tells them in the chat and make's them try again and if they don't answer at all it kicks them from the game.
